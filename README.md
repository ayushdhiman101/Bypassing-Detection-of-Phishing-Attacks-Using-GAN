Bypassing Detection of URL-based Phishing Attacks Using Generative Adversarial Deep Neural Networks

## Introduction
Phishing is one of the most widely used attacks to lure users into releasing valuable and confidential information. In phishing attacks, adversaries try to obtain user information through social engineering by using deception and make a person divulge private information or unwittingly provide unauthorized access to a computer system or network. Phishing is not a new attack, but it is still a source of significant percentage of security incidents [1]. Compared to spam, creating a phishing attack is difficult, since it is a targeted attack, short-lived, often occurring for only a few hours, more dynamic, and moving among servers very quickly. Therefore, adversaries usually need to change their attack strategies quite often.
